# Study of Age, Metallicity, and Extra-Tidal Region of a Globular Cluster NGC 4147

This project was carried out as part of the course **PH-EL64: Observational Astronomy Lab** in the MSc Physics curriculum at the **Department of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Delhi**.

## Authors

- Anisha Khatri  
- Khushi Gupta  
- Simran Kumari

## Objective

- To study the **age**, **metallicity**, and **extra-tidal region** of the globular cluster **NGC 4147** using data from Gaia DR3. 
- To identify extra-tidal candidates based on cluster and stellar proper motions, and their positions on the color–magnitude diagram.
- Analyze the spatial distribution of these stars to understand the cluster’s dynamical history within the Milky Way.


## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy astropy
```
## Usage 

Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook named `ObsAstroLab (1).ipynb`. Run the notebook cells in sequence to follow the full data analysis and visualization pipeline.
